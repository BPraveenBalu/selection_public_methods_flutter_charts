# SelectionBehavior public methods in flutter chart


The Flutter Cartesian Chart widget provides support to programmatically do the data points selection on the charts using the public methods. Public methods are methods that can be called by using the class object where they are defined. Likewise, our chart widget also has a public method to select the data points in the charts dynamically called as selectionIndex method.
